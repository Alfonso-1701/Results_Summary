## My process

Started with analyzing the different levels of content on the page. I looked to see how they connected to each other, having a small idea of how to best layout the markup. When doing the markup I took it piece by piece, questioning, how the piece interacted with those before and after it.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Really just came across making a circle you want to set the width and the height. Stacked some divs inside divs applying flex to them. While it wasn't as natural as I would like, there was definetely some comfort there. 

### Continued development

I feel like my workflow has become more regimented and organized. I also think my code is mostly organized. I would love to see what are some industry practices that I can implement to take it to the next level.
